# WSB Merito final project Robot Framework

## About

This repository contains the second part of my final project for Python programming postgraduate studies at WSB Merito University.
 
The project consists of two parts:
1. Automated tests of the [Generic Shop](https://skleptest.pl) written in Selenium.
1. Automated tests of the [Generic Shop](https://skleptest.pl) website written in Robot Framework.

This repository contains tests written in Robot Framework. 
You can find the tests in Selenium [here](https://github.com/marta-rakowska/wsb_final_project_selenium).
 
There are 7 tests:
* Create an account
* Log out of the account
* Reset password
* Search for „Magnolia dress”
* Go to "All" category
* Buy "Rocadi Jeans" without creating an account
* Subscribe to newsletter
 
As a proof that all tests work, I made screencasts that are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VvmahkSfZ3eQO9-QonTmAgK2rweLv4g_?usp=sharing).
 
Detailed test cases are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KHLrWZf3Du5qH1w9P2FqznwWza2P3mPB?usp=sharing).
